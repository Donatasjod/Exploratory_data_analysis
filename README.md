<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/">Roger D. Peng</a> </p>
<hr /><h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data. These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data. We will cover in detail the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics. We will also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.</p>
<hr /><h2>Course Content</h2>
<ul><li>Making exploratory graphs</li>
<li>Principles of analytic graphics</li>
<li>Plotting systems and graphics devices in R</li>
<li>The base, lattice, and ggplot2 plotting systems in R</li>
<li>Clustering methods</li>
<li>Dimension reduction techniques</li>
</ul><hr /><h2>Lecture Materials</h2>
<p>Lecture videos will be released weekly and will be available for the week and thereafter. You are welcome to view them at your convenience. Accompanying each video lecture will be a PDF copy of the slides and a link to an HTML5 version of the slides. </p>
<h3>Course Textbook</h3>
<p>The book <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/exdata">Exploratory Data Analysis with R</a></em> covers the lecture material in this course.</p>
<hr /><h2>Assessments</h2>
<h3>Quizzes</h3>
<p>There will be two quizzes. The quizzes will open on the
first day of the course. Quiz 1 is due at the end of the first week, and Quiz 2 is due at the end of the second week. Please refer to the individual Quizzes to see the exact
date and time that each Quiz is due. Quizzes are accessed by clicking the Quizzes link in the left navigation bar.</p>
<h3>Course Projects</h3>
<p>The two course projects will be assessed via peer assessment. In
these projects, you will be asked to construct or reproduce certain
plots, the purpose of which is to make you familiar with various plotting options. You will be evaluated on the plot that you produce and the code
that you write to construct the plot. Course projects evaluated via peer
assessment will make use of your GitHub account. Course Projects are accessed by clicking the Course Projects link in the left navigation bar.</p>
<h3>Points and Scoring</h3>
<ul><li>Quiz 1: 20%</li>
<li>Quiz 2: 20%</li>
<li>Course Project 1: 25%</li>
<li>Course Project 2: 35%</li>
</ul><p>You must earn 70% to pass the course and earn a certificate. Students who earn 90% and above will receive a certificate with Distinction.</p>
